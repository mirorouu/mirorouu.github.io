		Non-semantic tags are HTML elements that do not provide 
		any meaning about what content they contain. Semantic Tags
		are also HTML elemtents, however they provide meaning
		about the content they contain.

	<p>
		One benefit of using semantic tags is they improve 
		accessibiltity to developers who may not understand 
		non-semantic tags. they also make it more readable
		for machines and search engines to understand the 
		content of the webpage.
